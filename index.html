   <p>To understand what a remote repository is, itâ€™s important to first understand that Git stores and operates on your data in your local file system. In fact, Git is referred to as a distributed version control system because the source code is stored, or distributed, locally across any number of computers and servers. This is different from many of the source control tools that preceded Git. </p>
